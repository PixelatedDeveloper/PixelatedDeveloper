After years of creating themes and barely being able to manage them i decided i needed a central platform manage my projects. Meet [CanitiaThemes](https://github.com/Canitia). CanitiaThemes houses all kinds of themes like the Ghost theme [Larua](https://github.com/Canitia/larua) and it's Hugo-based counterpart [Larua-Hugo](https://github.com/Canitia/larua-hugo).

**The HowOnSwitch project**

As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [Switch](https://github.com/PixelatedDeveloper/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs. I've had a few people helping me already but more pull-requests are always welcome.

**About me**
Some random things about me: 
- 🖥️ My main PC has a Ryzen 2600, 16GB RAM and a Vega 56. 
- 📺 The last anime i finished was Haikyuu! To the Top 2nd Season.
- 🎮 The game i play most is Rocket League.
