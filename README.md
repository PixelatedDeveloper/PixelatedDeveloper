# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael. I create theme's for Ghost, WordPress and Hugo which i manage through [Canitia](https://github.com/Canitia). 

**The HowOnSwitch project**

As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [HowOnSwitch](github.com/boumannm/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs.

**Contact me**

To get in contact you are probably best of contacting my Twitter.
