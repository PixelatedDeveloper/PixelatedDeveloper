After years of creating themes i decided i needed a central 'brand' manage my projects. Meet [PixelatedDeveloper](https://github.com/pixelateddeveloper). <br />

## The HowOnSwitch project
As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [Switch](https://github.com/PixelatedDeveloper/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs. I've had a few people helping me already but more pull-requests are always welcome.
