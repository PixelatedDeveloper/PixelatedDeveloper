# Hi 👋

I'm Michael. 

I create theme's for Ghost, WordPress and Hugo which i manage through [Canitia](https://github.com/Canitia). Check out the Ghost theme [Larua](https://github.com/Canitia/larua) and it's Hugo-based counterpart [Larua-Hugo](https://github.com/Canitia/larua-hugo) for example. 

Some random things about me: 
- 🖥️ My main PC has a Ryzen 2600, 16GB RAM and a Vega 56. 
- 📺 The last anime i finished was Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld 2nd Season.
- 🎮 The game i play most is Rocket League.

New idea's and random theme fluff are managed from [Canitia Xperiments](https://github.com/CanitiaX). A recently promoted theme from the Xperiments branch to Canitia was [Pharos](https://github.com/Canitia/pharos), which started as a experiment but ended up as a simple and fast theme for Hugo.

**The HowOnSwitch project**

As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [HowOnSwitch](https://github.com/boumannm/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs. I've had a few people helping me already but more pull-requests are always welcome.
