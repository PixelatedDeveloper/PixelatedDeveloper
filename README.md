After years of creating templates and themes i needed a central 'brand' to manage my projects. Meet [PixelatedDeveloper](https://github.com/pixelateddeveloper). PixelatedDeveloper creates (mostly) open-source themes for many platforms including Ghost, Hugo, Jekyll and WordPress. New in late 2020 are Premium theme's which get a bit more attention and support. The first Premium theme is yet to fully launch, but it's called Zen (or 'Project Zen' in my dev work).

## The HowOnSwitch project
As a tech-geek and a gamer i wanted to combine my latest gaming toy (the Nintendo Switch) and the technical side of games released on it. This led to my current project [Switch](https://github.com/PixelatedDeveloper/switch). A project showing how games released on it run, what resolution, what FPS and other related specs. I've had a few people helping me already but more pull-requests are always welcome.
